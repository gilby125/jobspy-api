# Go Scrapers Implementation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the current implementation status of the Go-based job scrapers that integrate with the existing Python Jobspy API.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components

#### Core Infrastructure
- **Configuration System** (`internal/config/config.go`)
  - Environment variable loading
  - YAML config file support
  - Validation and defaults
  - Site-specific configurations

- **Redis Client** (`internal/redis/client.go`)
  - Production-ready connection pooling
  - Queue operations (push/pop tasks)
  - Health monitoring integration
  - Error reporting to Redis channels

- **Protocol Definitions** (`internal/protocol/types.go`)
  - Task and result message formats
  - Health status structures
  - Error reporting types
  - Redis channel constants

- **Scraper Interface** (`internal/scraper/interface.go`)
  - Common scraper interface
  - Configuration structures
  - Error types and validation
  - Metrics and monitoring interfaces

#### Worker System
- **Worker Orchestrator** (`internal/worker/orchestrator.go`)
  - Multi-worker coordination
  - Task distribution and load balancing
  - Metrics collection and reporting
  - Graceful shutdown handling

- **Individual Workers** (`internal/worker/worker.go`)
  - Task processing with retry logic
  - Exponential backoff for failures
  - Performance metrics tracking
  - Error classification and handling

- **Health Monitor** (`internal/worker/health_monitor.go`)
  - Real-time health status reporting
  - System metrics collection (memory, CPU)
  - Error rate monitoring
  - Redis health status publishing

#### Scraper Implementation
- **Indeed Scraper** (`internal/scrapers/indeed/scraper.go`)
  - HTML parsing with goquery
  - Anti-detection headers
  - Rate limiting and delays
  - CAPTCHA detection
  - Job data extraction

- **Scraper Factory** (`internal/scraper/factory.go`)
  - Dynamic scraper instantiation
  - Configuration management
  - Currently supports Indeed only

#### Application Entry Point
- **Main Application** (`main.go`)
  - Configuration loading
  - Component initialization
  - Graceful shutdown handling
  - Signal handling for SIGINT/SIGTERM

### ⚠️ Known Issues Fixed
1. **Import Errors**: Removed references to non-existent LinkedIn and Glassdoor packages
2. **Factory Configuration**: Updated to only support implemented scrapers
3. **Package Structure**: Verified all imports reference existing files

### 🚧 Pending Implementation

#### Additional Scrapers
- **LinkedIn Scraper** - Requires browser automation (chromedp)
- **Glassdoor Scraper** - Needs advanced anti-detection measures
- **ZipRecruiter Scraper** - Standard HTTP scraping
- **Google Jobs Scraper** - API-based integration

#### Advanced Features
- **Anti-Detection Manager** - Proxy rotation, browser fingerprinting
- **Rate Limiter** - Sophisticated request throttling
- **Proxy Manager** - Health checking and rotation
- **User Agent Manager** - Dynamic rotation and validation

## Architecture Integration

### Current Integration Points
```
Python FastAPI ──→ Redis Queues ──→ Go Workers ──→ Redis Results ──→ Python Processing
```

### Message Flow
1. Python API receives job search request
2. Creates scraping task, pushes to Redis queue (`scraping:tasks:indeed`)
3. Go worker pops task from queue
4. Go worker executes scraping with Indeed scraper
5. Go worker publishes result to Redis (`scraping:results`)
6. Python API retrieves and processes results

### Health Monitoring
- Go workers report health status to Redis every 60 seconds
- Health keys: `scrapers:health:indeed:worker-id`
- Python API can query worker health status
- Metrics include: tasks completed, error rates, memory usage

## Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Testing**: Create integration tests with existing Python API
2. **LinkedIn Scraper**: Implement with chromedp for browser automation
3. **Error Handling**: Improve error classification and retry logic

### Medium Priority
4. **Glassdoor Scraper**: Implement with advanced anti-detection
5. **Proxy Management**: Add proxy rotation and health checking
6. **Performance Optimization**: Add connection pooling and caching

### Future Enhancements
7. **ZipRecruiter & Google Scrapers**: Complete the scraper collection
8. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time worker performance monitoring
9. **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic worker scaling based on queue depth

## Notes
- All scrapers follow the same interface for consistency
- Redis is used for all inter-service communication
- Go workers are designed to be stateless and horizontally scalable
- Health monitoring ensures system reliability and observability
